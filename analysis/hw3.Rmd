The largest value of a standard normal density function can be calculated as follows:
```{r}

# Set the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution
mu <- 0
sigma <- 1

# Calculate the density of the normal distribution at x = 0
peak <- dnorm(x = 0, mean = mu, sd = sigma)

# Print the peak value
print(peak)


```

This is equal to 
```{r} 

1/sqrt(2*pi)

```
